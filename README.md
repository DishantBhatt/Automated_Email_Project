# Automated_Email_Project


This project was done for my data analysis internship. It takes information from an excel or csv file if need be, and sends customized emails to each person. The csv file must contain first and last name columns, email column, phone number, etc. all labeled correctly.

The email was made with html and sent as an html email.

The code iterates throught the data frame sending emails one by one.
